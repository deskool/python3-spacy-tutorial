There was once a little boy named Ben, that liked to play with fire. His mother told him that fire was dangerous, so he decided that he would buy a box of matches and head to the lake. As an extra precaution, he swam to the bottom of the lake and lit a fire. There he met a fish who has cold and sat beside him at the bottom of the lake. The fish asked the boy "how did you light a fire underwater?" to which the boy responded "How would a fish know what fire looks like?". "The stars are on fire" said the fish, "and from my home in the lake, I can see the stars at night". "Now how would you know that stars are on fire?" said the boy. "In the same way that you know I am fish" relplied the fish.
